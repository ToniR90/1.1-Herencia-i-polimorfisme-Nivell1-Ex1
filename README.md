# 1.1-Herencia-i-polimorfisme-Nivell1-Ex1

📄 Description - Exercise Statement
This project focuses on creating a hierarchy of classes to represent different types of musical instruments and exploring Java concepts such as **abstract classes**, **static blocks**, and **initialization blocks**.

Exercise Objective:
1. Create a base abstract class `Instrument` with the attributes `name` and `price`. Define an abstract method `play()` that must be implemented by its subclasses.
2. Create the following subclasses:
   - `WindInstrument`: Implements `play()` to display "A wind instrument is playing".
   - `StringedInstrument`: Implements `play()` to display "A stringed instrument is playing".
   - `PercussionInstrument`: Implements `play()` to display "A percussion instrument is playing".
3. Demonstrate that a class's loading process happens only once. This can be shown by:
   - Creating the first instance of the class.
   - Accessing a static member of the class without creating an instance.
4. Research and use **static blocks** and **initialization blocks** in Java to illustrate the class loading process.
